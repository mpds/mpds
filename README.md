### Hi there! 👋



My name is Matheus Müller, and I'm a biologist (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) and a computer modeller (National Laboratory for Scientific Computing). I'm mainly interested in machine learning techniques applied to biology and health-related areas. I also enjoy wondering and discussing topics such as environment, society, technology and cats 🐈. Currently a PhD student @ [LNCC](https://www.lncc.br/), Brazil.
