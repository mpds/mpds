My name is Matheus MÃ¼ller, and I'm a biologist (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) and a computer modeller (National Laboratory for Scientific Computing). I'm mainly interested in machine learning techniques applied to biology and health-related areas. 

Currently a PhD student @ [LNCC](https://www.lncc.br/), Brazil.
